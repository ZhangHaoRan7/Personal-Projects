Supervised, Semi-Supervised, and Unsupervised Learning

Data Source: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29. Download the data in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.data, which
has IDs, classes (Benign=B, Malignant=M), and 30 attributes. This data has two output classes.

Repeated the following procedures for supervised, un-supervised, and semi-supervised learning M = 30 times, and use randomly selected train and test data (make sure you use 20% of both the positve and negative classes as the test set). Then compare the average scores (accuracy, precision,recall, F1-score, and AUC) that you obtain from each algorithm.
